     <p> The digital world is what Generation Z lives and breathes. Social networking, information deluge, and fast breakthroughs
        in physical hardware have all infiltrated the Generation Z mind in profoundly different ways. <br> <br> Gen Z is one of the first generations to grow up in the era of social media, which has changed the way we think and act
        in everyday life. It has even become a significant aspect of our political participation.</p>

        <p>WeÂ are realistic, respect connections, and love individuals regardless of how unlike they are or how "shocking" their
        lives may be. <br> <br> We want to be self-starters who find innovative methods to educate ourselves and improve our lives. <br><br> We
        despise hypocrisy and refuse to follow organisations only on the basis of their apparent authority. <br><br> Before accepting
        anything as true, we also want to see proof. <br><br> We are the better future.</p>
