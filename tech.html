                As AIs go from reactive order-takers to proactive change-makers, they advance up the value chain. <br> <br> The capacity of AI
                assistants to foresee and respond in a way that we, as humans, find useful rather than annoying will undoubtedly
                determine their destiny. <br>To reduce the chance of societal biases and preconceptions sabotaging outcomes before wide-scale implementation, leaders
                and engineers must cooperate to uncover and prevent "algorithmic catastrophes."  <br><br><b class="boldy">If AI is just permitted to accelerate the occurrence of harmful behaviour, it will never be a catalyst for change in the
