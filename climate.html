                        <p>The climate has altered dramatically during the Earth's 4.5-billion-year existence. This is real. However, normal
                        warming and cooling cycles cannot account for the current fast warming. Changes that would ordinarily take hundreds of
                        thousands of years are happening in a matter of decades. <br><br> This is no longer an excuse not to act on climate
                        change and push the burden onto future generations</p>

        <p class="maintext">Climate change is already having a disastrous effect on global food supply, as well as rising migration, violence,
        illness, and economic uncertainty, and this will only become worse if we don't act immediately. The greatest
        environmental concern of our time is man-made climate change. <br> <br>  It compromises the existence of the planet on which we
        exist, and WE are the last generation capable of intervening. <br><br>Consider climate concerns on a local, national, and global scale - analyse your leaders' sustainability and ecological
        platforms, interact with them to learn about their goals, and, in the end, vote for the candidates who have clear, bold,
        and persuasive strategies to safeguard our world. <br><br> <span class="bold">Everyone has the power to contribute to the solution of our climate crisis, but we can all do more. What's your
        strategy?</span> </p>
